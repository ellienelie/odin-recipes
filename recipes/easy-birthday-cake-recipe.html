        <h2>Steps</h2>
                <h3>Cake</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees and spray two 9-inch cake 
                            pans liberally with cooking spray, or grease and flour. 
                            (Can also use a 9x13-inch pan or line 24 muffin tins 
                            with paper liners for cupcakes).
                        </li>
                        <li>Combine sugar and butter in a large bowl and cream 
                            together with an electric mixer.
                        </li>
                        <li>In a medium-sized bowl, stir together the flour, baking 
                            powder, and salt with a spoon. In a separate bowl, stir 
                            together the eggs, milk, and vanilla until well combined.
                        </li>
                        <li>Add half of the wet mixture and the flour mixture to the 
                            creamed butter and mix until well combined. Add the 
                            remaining and continue mixing until fully blended and 
                            smooth, about 2 to 3 minutes.
                        </li>
                        <li>If you want to add sprinkles, gently stir them using a 
                            spoon, once the cake batter is fully blended.
                        </li>
                        <li>Divide the cake mix evenly among the two cake pans. Bake 
                            for 30 to 35 minutes, or until lightly browned and center 
                            springs back when lightly pressed. Remove from oven and 
                            allow to cool in pans for 10 minutes before turning out to 
                            cool completely.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                <h3>Buttercream Icing</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a large bowl, cream the butter and about 1 cup of 
                            confectioner's sugar with an electric mixer until light 
                            and fluffy. Add the butter flavoring, half of the milk, 
                            and the remaining sugar, and beat again until smooth and 
                            creamy, scraping down the sides and adding a little extra 
                            milk if needed.
                        </li>
                        <li>Ice the cooled cake and enjoy!</li>
                    </ol>
